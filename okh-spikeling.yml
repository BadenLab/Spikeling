title: Spikeling - A hardware implementation of the Izhikevich model of a spiking neuron.   # required | text | A title to identify the thing

description: |
    Understanding of how neurons encode and compute information is fundamental to our study of the brain, but opportunities for hands-on experience with neurophysiological techniques on live neurons are scarce in science education. Here, we present Spikeling, an open source Â£25 in silico implementation of a spiking neuron that mimics a wide range of neuronal behaviours for classroom education and public neuroscience outreach.

intended-use: |                            # recommended | Paragraph
    Spikeling is a device for teaching how neurons work
